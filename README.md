# Stock Market Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict stock market prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes historical stock data to forecast future prices, helping investors and analysts make informed decisions. The model is trained on stock market datasets and employs time series forecasting techniques.

## 🔧 Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature engineering for stock price prediction
- Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, LSTM, and ARIMA
- Model evaluation and accuracy analysis
- Interactive dashboard for visualization

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning (LSTMs)
- Flask/Dash for web-based visualization

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains historical stock market prices, including:
- Open price
- Close price
- High & Low prices
- Volume traded

You can obtain the dataset from sources like Yahoo Finance, Kaggle, or Alpha Vantage.
